<!-- This is the abstract -->

This work deals with a novel approach to remesh trianglular meshes that facilitates a surface interpolation by Radial Basis Fuctions (RBFs). 
While serving a representation of the surface for remeshing this interpolation also allows to obtain a normalvector to the surface which is used in a higher-dimensional embedding sheme to yield a curvature adapted mesh ie. smaller triangle-sizes where the curvature is larger.

A remeshing-program that incorporates the resulting algorithm was implemented and a parameter study for the interpolation conducted.

Consequently the program was used to remesh the isosurfaces obtained from several phase-field topology optimizations.
