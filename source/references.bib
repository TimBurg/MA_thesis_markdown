	title = {Curvature-Adapted Remeshing of {CAD} Surfaces},
	abstract = {A common representation of surfaces with complicated topology and geometry is through composite parametric surfaces as is the case for most {CAD} modelers. A challenging problem is how to generate a mesh of such a surface that well approximates the geometry of the surface, preserves its topology and important geometric features, and contains nicely shaped elements. In this work, we present an optimization-based surface remeshing method that is able to satisfy many of these requirements simultaneously. This method is inspired by the recent work of Le´vy and Bonneel (Proc. 21th International Meshing Roundtable, October 2012), which embeds a smooth surface into a high-dimensional space and remesh it uniformly in that embedding space. Our method works directly in the 3d spaces and uses an embedding space in R6 to evaluate mesh size and mesh quality. It generates a curvatureadapted anisotropic surface mesh that well represents the geometry of the surface with a low number of elements. We illustrate our approach through various examples.},

An object’s surface is deﬁned implicitly as the zero set of an {RBF} ﬁtted to the given surface data. Fast methods for ﬁtting and evaluating {RBFs} allow us to model large data sets, consisting of millions of surface points, by a single {RBF}—previously an impossible task. A greedy algorithm in the ﬁtting process reduces the number of {RBF} centers required to represent a surface and results in signiﬁcant compression and further computational advantages. The energy-minimisation characterisation of polyharmonic splines result in a “smoothest” interpolant. This scale-independent characterisation is well-suited to reconstructing surfaces from nonuniformly sampled data. Holes are smoothly ﬁlled and surfaces smoothly extrapolated. We use a non-interpolating approximation when the data is noisy. The functional representation is in effect a solid model, which means that gradients and surface normals can be determined analytically. This helps generate uniform meshes and we show that the {RBF} representation has advantages for mesh simpliﬁcation and remeshing applications. Results are presented for real-world rangeﬁnder data.},

	abstract = {A new algorithm for the generation of anisotropic, unstructured triangular meshes in two dimensions is described. Inputs to the algorithm are the boundary geometry and a metric that speciﬁes the desired element size and shape as a function of position. The algorithm is an example of what we call pliant mesh generation. It ﬁrst constructs the constrained Delaunay triangulation of the domain, then iteratively smooths, reﬁnes, and retriangulates. On each iteration, a node is selected at random, it is repositioned according to attraction/repulsion with its neighbors, the neighborhood is retriangulated, and nodes are inserted or deleted as necessary. All operations are done relative to the metric tensor. This simple method generates high quality meshes whose elements conform well to the requested shape metric. The method appears particularly well suited to surface meshing and viscous ﬂow simulations, where stretched triangles are desirable, and to time-dependent remeshing problems.},

All these applications share one mathematical foundation: high dimensional approximation/interpolation. This paper explains why radial basis functions are preferred to multi-variate polynomials for scattered data approximation in high-dimensional space; and gives a brief description on how to construct the most commonly used compactly supported radial basis functions. Without sophisticated mathematics, one can construct a compactly supported (radial) basis function with required smoothness according to procedures described here. Short programs and tables for compactly supported radial basis functions are supplied.},

	abstract = {Under very mild additional assumptions, translates of conditionally positive deﬁnite radial basis functions allow unique interpolation to scattered multivariate data, because the interpolation matrices have a symmetric and positive deﬁnite dominant part. In many applications, the data density varies locally, and then the translates should get diﬀerent scalings that match the local data density. Furthermore, if there is a local anisotropy in the data, the radial basis functions should be distorted into functions with ellipsoids as level sets. In such cases, the symmetry and the deﬁniteness of the matrices are lost. However, this paper provides suﬃcient conditions for the unique solvability of such interpolation processes. The basic technique is a matrix perturbation argument combined with the Ball–Narcowich–Ward stability results.},

	abstract = {For a number of computational purposes, including visualization of scientific data and registration of multimodal medical data, smooth curves must be approximated by polygonal curves, and surfaces by polyhedral surfaces. An inherent problem of these approximation algorithms is that the resulting curves and surfaces appear faceted. Boundary-following and iso-surface construction algorithms are typical examples. To reduce the apparent faceting, smoothing methods are used. In this paper, we introduce a new method for smoothing piecewise linear shapes of arbitrary dimension and topology. This new method is in fact a linear low-pass filter that removes high-curvature variations, and does not produce shrinkage. Its computational complexity is linear in the number of edges or faces of the shape, and the required storage is linear in the number of vertices.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

The proposed method has the same functional capabilities as a structural optimization method based on the level set method incorporating perimeter control functions. The advantage of the method is the simplicity of computation, since extra operations such as re-initialization of functions are not required. Structural shapes are represented by the phase field function defined in the design domain, and optimization of this function is performed by solving a time-dependent reaction diffusion equation. The artificial double well potential function used in the equation is derived from sensitivity analysis. The proposed method is applied to two-dimensional linear elastic and vibration optimization problems such as the minimum compliance problem, a compliant mechanism design problem and the eigenfrequency maximization problem. The numerical examples provided illustrate the convergence of the various objective functions and the effect that perimeter control has on the optimal configurations.},
