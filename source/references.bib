	title = {Curvature-Adapted Remeshing of {CAD} Surfaces},
	abstract = {A common representation of surfaces with complicated topology and geometry is through composite parametric surfaces as is the case for most {CAD} modelers. A challenging problem is how to generate a mesh of such a surface that well approximates the geometry of the surface, preserves its topology and important geometric features, and contains nicely shaped elements. In this work, we present an optimization-based surface remeshing method that is able to satisfy many of these requirements simultaneously. This method is inspired by the recent work of Le´vy and Bonneel (Proc. 21th International Meshing Roundtable, October 2012), which embeds a smooth surface into a high-dimensional space and remesh it uniformly in that embedding space. Our method works directly in the 3d spaces and uses an embedding space in R6 to evaluate mesh size and mesh quality. It generates a curvatureadapted anisotropic surface mesh that well represents the geometry of the surface with a low number of elements. We illustrate our approach through various examples.},

	abstract = {We use polyharmonic Radial Basis Functions ({RBFs}) to reconstruct smooth, manifold surfaces from point-cloud data and to repair incomplete meshes. An object’s surface is deﬁned implicitly as the zero set of an {RBF} ﬁtted to the given surface data. Fast methods for ﬁtting and evaluating {RBFs} allow us to model large data sets, consisting of millions of surface points, by a single {RBF}—previously an impossible task. A greedy algorithm in the ﬁtting process reduces the number of {RBF} centers required to represent a surface and results in signiﬁcant compression and further computational advantages. The energy-minimisation characterisation of polyharmonic splines result in a “smoothest” interpolant. This scale-independent characterisation is well-suited to reconstructing surfaces from nonuniformly sampled data. Holes are smoothly ﬁlled and surfaces smoothly extrapolated. We use a non-interpolating approximation when the data is noisy. The functional representation is in effect a solid model, which means that gradients and surface normals can be determined analytically. This helps generate uniform meshes and we show that the {RBF} representation has advantages for mesh simpliﬁcation and remeshing applications. Results are presented for real-world rangeﬁnder data.},

	title = {A Pliant Method for Anisotropic Mesh Generation},
	abstract = {A new algorithm for the generation of anisotropic, unstructured triangular meshes in two dimensions is described. Inputs to the algorithm are the boundary geometry and a metric that speciﬁes the desired element size and shape as a function of position. The algorithm is an example of what we call pliant mesh generation. It ﬁrst constructs the constrained Delaunay triangulation of the domain, then iteratively smooths, reﬁnes, and retriangulates. On each iteration, a node is selected at random, it is repositioned according to attraction/repulsion with its neighbors, the neighborhood is retriangulated, and nodes are inserted or deleted as necessary. All operations are done relative to the metric tensor. This simple method generates high quality meshes whose elements conform well to the requested shape metric. The method appears particularly well suited to surface meshing and viscous ﬂow simulations, where stretched triangles are desirable, and to time-dependent remeshing problems.},

	abstract = {The use of radial basis functions have attracted increasing attention in recent years as an elegant scheme for high-dimensional scattered data approximation, an practical method for machine learning, one of the foundations of mesh-free methods, an alternative way to construct higher order methods for solving partial diﬀerential equations ({PDEs}), an emerging method for solving {PDEs} on surfaces, a novel method for mesh repair and so on. All these applications share one mathematical foundation: high dimensional approximation/interpolation. This paper explains why radial basis functions are preferred to multi-variate polynomials for scattered data approximation in high-dimensional space; and gives a brief description on how to construct the most commonly used compactly supported radial basis functions. Without sophisticated mathematics, one can construct a compactly supported (radial) basis function with required smoothness according to procedures described here. Short programs and tables for compactly supported radial basis functions are supplied.},

@article{bozzini_interpolation_nodate,

	abstract = {Under very mild additional assumptions, translates of conditionally positive deﬁnite radial basis functions allow unique interpolation to scattered multivariate data, because the interpolation matrices have a symmetric and positive deﬁnite dominant part. In many applications, the data density varies locally, and then the translates should get diﬀerent scalings that match the local data density. Furthermore, if there is a local anisotropy in the data, the radial basis functions should be distorted into functions with ellipsoids as level sets. In such cases, the symmetry and the deﬁniteness of the matrices are lost. However, this paper provides suﬃcient conditions for the unique solvability of such interpolation processes. The basic technique is a matrix perturbation argument combined with the Ball–Narcowich–Ward stability results.},
