	title = {Curvature-Adapted Remeshing of {CAD} Surfaces},
	abstract = {A common representation of surfaces with complicated topology and geometry is through composite parametric surfaces as is the case for most {CAD} modelers. A challenging problem is how to generate a mesh of such a surface that well approximates the geometry of the surface, preserves its topology and important geometric features, and contains nicely shaped elements. In this work, we present an optimization-based surface remeshing method that is able to satisfy many of these requirements simultaneously. This method is inspired by the recent work of Le´vy and Bonneel (Proc. 21th International Meshing Roundtable, October 2012), which embeds a smooth surface into a high-dimensional space and remesh it uniformly in that embedding space. Our method works directly in the 3d spaces and uses an embedding space in R6 to evaluate mesh size and mesh quality. It generates a curvatureadapted anisotropic surface mesh that well represents the geometry of the surface with a low number of elements. We illustrate our approach through various examples.},

An object’s surface is deﬁned implicitly as the zero set of an {RBF} ﬁtted to the given surface data. Fast methods for ﬁtting and evaluating {RBFs} allow us to model large data sets, consisting of millions of surface points, by a single {RBF}—previously an impossible task. A greedy algorithm in the ﬁtting process reduces the number of {RBF} centers required to represent a surface and results in signiﬁcant compression and further computational advantages. The energy-minimisation characterisation of polyharmonic splines result in a “smoothest” interpolant. This scale-independent characterisation is well-suited to reconstructing surfaces from nonuniformly sampled data. Holes are smoothly ﬁlled and surfaces smoothly extrapolated. We use a non-interpolating approximation when the data is noisy. The functional representation is in effect a solid model, which means that gradients and surface normals can be determined analytically. This helps generate uniform meshes and we show that the {RBF} representation has advantages for mesh simpliﬁcation and remeshing applications. Results are presented for real-world rangeﬁnder data.},

	abstract = {A new algorithm for the generation of anisotropic, unstructured triangular meshes in two dimensions is described. Inputs to the algorithm are the boundary geometry and a metric that speciﬁes the desired element size and shape as a function of position. The algorithm is an example of what we call pliant mesh generation. It ﬁrst constructs the constrained Delaunay triangulation of the domain, then iteratively smooths, reﬁnes, and retriangulates. On each iteration, a node is selected at random, it is repositioned according to attraction/repulsion with its neighbors, the neighborhood is retriangulated, and nodes are inserted or deleted as necessary. All operations are done relative to the metric tensor. This simple method generates high quality meshes whose elements conform well to the requested shape metric. The method appears particularly well suited to surface meshing and viscous ﬂow simulations, where stretched triangles are desirable, and to time-dependent remeshing problems.},

All these applications share one mathematical foundation: high dimensional approximation/interpolation. This paper explains why radial basis functions are preferred to multi-variate polynomials for scattered data approximation in high-dimensional space; and gives a brief description on how to construct the most commonly used compactly supported radial basis functions. Without sophisticated mathematics, one can construct a compactly supported (radial) basis function with required smoothness according to procedures described here.

In many applications, the data density varies locally, and then the translates should get diﬀerent scalings that match the local data density. Furthermore, if there is a local anisotropy in the data, the radial basis functions should be distorted into functions with ellipsoids as level sets. In such cases, the symmetry and the deﬁniteness of the matrices are lost. However, this paper provides suﬃcient conditions for the unique solvability of such interpolation processes. The basic technique is a matrix perturbation argument combined with the Ball–Narcowich–Ward stability results.},

The advantage of the method is the simplicity of computation, since extra operations such as re-initialization of functions are not required. Structural shapes are represented by the phase field function defined in the design domain, and optimization of this function is performed by solving a time-dependent reaction diffusion equation. The artificial double well potential function used in the equation is derived from sensitivity analysis. The proposed method is applied to two-dimensional linear elastic and vibration optimization problems such as the minimum compliance problem, a compliant mechanism design problem and the eigenfrequency maximization problem. The numerical examples provided illustrate the convergence of the various objective functions and the effect that perimeter control has on the optimal configurations.},

In practice, however, one often has to deal with several challenges. Some regions in the initial mesh may be overrefined, others too coarse. Additionally, the triangles may be too thin or not properly oriented. We present a novel mesh adaptation procedure which greatly improves the problematic input mesh and overcomes all of these drawbacks. By coupling surface reconstruction via radial basis functions with the higher dimensional embedding surface remeshing technique, we can automatically generate anisotropic meshes. Moreover, we are not only able to fill or coarsen certain mesh regions but also align the triangles according to the curvature of the reconstructed surface. This yields an acceptable trade-off between computational complexity and accuracy.},

	abstract = {We present, analyze, and implement a new method for the design of the stiffest structure subject to a pressure load or a given field of internal forces. Our structure is represented as a subset {\textless}i{\textgreater}S{\textless}i/{\textgreater} of a reference domain, and the complement of {\textless}i{\textgreater}S{\textless}i/{\textgreater} is made of two other “phases”, the “void” and a fictitious “liquid” that exerts a pressure force on its interface with the solid structure. The problem we consider is to minimize the compliance of the structure {\textless}i{\textgreater}S{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, which is the total work of the pressure and internal forces at the equilibrium displacement. In order to prevent from homogenization we add a penalization on the perimeter of {\textless}i{\textgreater}S{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. We propose an approximation of our problem in the framework of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Γ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-convergence, based on an approximation of our three phases by a smooth phase-field. We detail the numerical implementation of the approximate energies and show a few experiments.},

	abstract = {From the Publisher:"In many areas of mathematics, science and engineering, from computer graphics to inverse methods to signal processing it is necessary to estimate parameters, usually multidimensional, by approximation and interpolation. Radial basis functions are a modern and powerful tool which work well in very general circumstances, and so are becoming of widespread use, as the limitations of other methods, such as least squares, polynomial interpolation or wavelet-based, become apparent." This is the first book devoted to the subject and the author's aim is to give a thorough treatment from both the theoretical and practical implementation viewpoints. For example, he emphasises the many positive features of radial basis functions such as the unique solvability of the interpolation problem, the computation of interpolants, their smoothness and convergence, and provides a careful classification of the radial basis functions into types that have different convergence. A comprehensive bibliography rounds off what will prove a very valuable work.},

	title = {A Pliant Method for Anisotropic Mesh Generation},
	abstract = {A new algorithm for the generation of anisotropic, unstructured triangular meshes in two dimensions is described. Inputs to the algorithm are the boundary geometry and a metric that specifies the desired element size and shape as a function of position. The algorithm is an example of what we call pliant mesh generation. Itfirstconstructs the constrained Delaunay triangulation of the domain, then iteratively smooths, refines, and retriangulates. On each iteration, a node is selected at random, it is repositioned according to attraction/repulsion with its neighbors, the neighborhood is retriangulated, and nodes are inserted or deleted as necessary. All operations are done relative to the metric tensor. This simple method generates high quality meshes whose elements conform well to the requested shape metric. The method appears particularly well suited to surface meshing and viscous flow simulations, where stretched triangles are desirable, and to time-dependent remeshing problems. Keywords: unstructured mesh, Delaunay triangulation, element size function, Riemannian metric tensor, smoothing. 1},

This edition has been substantially revised and updated to reflect progress made in modelling and computational procedures. It also encompasses a comprehensive and unified description of the state-of-the-art of the so-called material distribution method, based on the use of mathematical programming and finite elements. Applications treated include not only structures but also {MEMS} and materials.},

An existence result for the nonlocal variational inequality is shown in a formulation involving Lagrange multipliers for local and nonlocal constraints. Local convergence of the discrete method is shown by interpreting the approach as a semismooth Newton method. Properties of the method are discussed and several numerical simulations demonstrate its efficiency. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Numer Methods Partial Differential Eq, 2013},
