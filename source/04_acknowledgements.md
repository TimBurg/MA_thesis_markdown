# Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

<!-- This is for acknowledging all of the people who helped out -->

First and foremost I want to thank my Grandma who helped me out financially during the course of writing this thesis but who 
is unfortunately not around anymore to witness its submission.

Then I want to thank the researchers of the Weierstra√ü Institute and in particular Patricio Farrell, Hang Si and Moritz Ebeling-Rump who 
always kindly helped me out with my queries.

I would also like to thank Timo Streckenbach who supported me with pdelib and the former WIAS researcher Thomas Petzold for their patience.

The thesis is written in pandoc markdown with a template from [@tom_pollard_template_2016].
